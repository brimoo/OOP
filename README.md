# OOP
Code for CSE165: Intro to OOP

## Requirements

The only requirement to run the labs in this repo is g++. The projects require OpenGL(it is recommended that you run the projects on a linux system).

## Running

To run any of the labs, simply compile the desired c++ source file in any of the lab directories.
Enter the following command to do this: `g++ -std=c++11 file_name.cpp -o program_name`. The program
can then be executed using the following command: `./program_name`. To run the projects, simply enter a
project directory and use the included Makefile by typing `make`. To remove the executable and object files
after you are done running the program, type `make clean`.

## Project Descriptions

1. Rendername: Renders my name using only polygons in OpenGL.
